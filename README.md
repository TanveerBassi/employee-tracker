# Employee Tracker

## About The Project

This app was built using Node.js and the inquirer package, with MySQL for the database.

The user is prompted with a set of choices for actions that they can take to interact with the data. When the user selects an option, they are presented with further questions or information relating to their choice and once completed, they are re-prompted with the initial question. This repeats in a loop until the user opts to exit the application.

Using the app, the user is able to build up data for a company, with tables for departments, job roles and employees. Once data has been added, the user can view the data tables in the terminal using the "view" options, or can choose to add to, update or delete the records.
